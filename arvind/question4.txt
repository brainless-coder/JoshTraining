delete one commit or multiple commits permanently 

to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently, we use git reset command with hard flag

to delete one commit:

git reset --hard HEAD~1: it will remove the latest commit
git reset --hard HEAD~n: it will remove n commits from the head(latest commit)
	
	
to delete multiple commits:
git reset --hard commit_id: it will remove all the commits upto that commit id
