squashing

if we want to combine two or more commits into one, then we can use squashing
 
git rebase -i: used for interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~n (here n denote number of commit count from head)
git rebase -i HEAD~2: this will squash the latest 2 commits into 1


if we have c1, c2, c3, c4 commits and we want to squash c2 and c3, then we will use:
git rebase -i HEAD~4
then in nano we will change the pick to squash/s for c3 to squash then into c2.
