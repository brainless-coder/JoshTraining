un stage changes from the staged area

we use the reset command with the soft flag for unstaging a file from staging area. By default if we dont write any flag, then it is soft flag only.


Usage:

git reset HEAD filename: this will unstage the file 
git reset --soft HEAD~n: this will unstage n commits from the head/latest commits
