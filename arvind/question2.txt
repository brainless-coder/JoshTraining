multiple remote repositories for the same project

we can easily create any number of remote repos for same project as per our need. Like there can be different remote repos on github, gitlab, heroku.

So, we can have, lets say one remote repo for development on github and another remote repo for deployment/prod on heroku. And according to our need, we can push our code to development or production repo.


Usage:

git remote add origin github_repo_url: adding github remote repo
git remote add heroku heroku_repo_url: adding heroku remote repo
git remote -v: for seeing all the remote repos

git push origin master: for pushing master branch to origin
git push herkou master: for pushing master branch to heroku
