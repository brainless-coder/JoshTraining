 --force push and --force-with-lease
 
 1) git push --force-with-lease: This command will not let us push if there is any extra commit on remote branch. It ensures that we do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing.
 
 2) git push --force: This command will forcefully push to remote branch by overriding all the changes of the remote branch. It overwrites a remote branch with our local branch.
